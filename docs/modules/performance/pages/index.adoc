The SKaiNET Performance Measurement Framework provides comprehensive tools for benchmarking tensor operations and analyzing computational performance across different backends and configurations.

== Overview

The performance measurement framework is designed to:

* Measure execution time and throughput of tensor operations
* Compare performance between different compute backends
* Provide statistical analysis of benchmark results
* Generate detailed performance reports
* Support multiplatform benchmarking

== Key Components

=== BenchmarkRunner

The `BenchmarkRunner` class is the core component that executes performance measurements:

[source,kotlin]
----
val runner = BenchmarkRunner()
val result = runner.benchmark(
    name = "Matrix Multiplication 256x256",
    warmupRuns = 10,
    measurementRuns = 100
) {
    // Your operation to benchmark
    backend.matmul(matrixA, matrixB)
}
----

=== Benchmark Results

The framework provides comprehensive result analysis:

* **TimeStatistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation, min/max execution times
* **MemoryStatistics**: Memory usage tracking (platform-dependent)
* **BenchmarkResult**: Complete benchmark results with metadata
* **BenchmarkReport**: Comprehensive reports for multiple operations

=== Performance Analysis

Advanced analysis capabilities include:

* Statistical analysis of execution times
* Throughput calculations (operations per second)
* Performance comparison between backends
* Speedup analysis and regression detection

== Quick Start

. Add the performance module dependency to your test configuration
. Create a `BenchmarkRunner` instance
. Use the `benchmark()` method to measure your operations
. Analyze results using the provided data classes

== Module Structure

The performance module (`skainet-core:skainet-performance`) contains:

* Core benchmarking infrastructure
* Result analysis and reporting tools
* Statistical utilities
* Multiplatform compatibility layer
