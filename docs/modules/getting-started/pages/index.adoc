Welcome to SKaiNET, a modern Kotlin multiplatform tensor computation library designed for machine learning and scientific computing. This guide will help you get started with practical, real-world examples.

== What is SKaiNET?

SKaiNET is a high-performance tensor computation framework that provides:

* **Multi-dimensional tensor operations** - Work with scalars, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays
* **Comprehensive mathematical operations** - Element-wise operations, matrix multiplication, linear algebra
* **Kotlin multiplatform support** - Run on JVM, Android, iOS, and native platforms
* **Clean, intuitive API** - Operator overloading makes tensor math feel natural
* **Performance-focused** - Optimized CPU backend with room for GPU acceleration

== Real-World Use Cases

This guide covers practical scenarios where SKaiNET excels:

=== 🤖 Machine Learning Foundations
* Neural network forward passes
* Gradient computations and backpropagation
* Feature transformations and preprocessing

== Quick Example

Here's a taste of what SKaiNET looks like in action:

[source,kotlin]
----
import sk.ainet.core.tensor.*
import sk.ainet.core.tensor.backend.*

// Create a CPU backend
val backend = CpuBackend()

// Create some tensors
val weights = CpuTensorFP32.fromArray(
    Shape(3, 2), 
    floatArrayOf(0.5f, -0.3f, 0.8f, 0.2f, -0.1f, 0.9f)
)

val input = CpuTensorFP32.fromArray(
    Shape(2, 1),
    floatArrayOf(1.0f, 0.5f)
)

// Matrix multiplication - the foundation of neural networks
val output = backend.matmul(weights, input)

// Element-wise operations with natural syntax
val scaled = backend.scale(output, 2.0)
val biased = scaled + 0.1f

println("Neural network output: [${biased[0,0]}, ${biased[1,0]}, ${biased[2,0]}]")
