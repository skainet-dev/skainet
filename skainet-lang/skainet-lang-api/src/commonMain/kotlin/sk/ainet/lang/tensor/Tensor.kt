/**
 * The core tensor abstraction in the SKaiNET framework, representing a fundamental
 * architectural decision to compose tensors from data and operations.
 *
 * ## Fundamental Architectural Decision: Tensor Composition
 *
 * This interface embodies a key architectural principle in the SKaiNET framework:
 * **tensors are composed of two distinct, complementary components:**
 *
 * 1. **Data Component (`TensorData`)** - Responsible for:
 *    - Multi-dimensional data storage and indexing
 *    - Memory layout and access patterns
 *    - Shape and dimensional metadata
 *    - Type-safe element access
 *
 * 2. **Operations Component (`TensorOps`)** - Responsible for:
 *    - Mathematical operations and transformations
 *    - Computational algorithms
 *    - Operation chaining and composition
 *    - Performance-optimized implementations
 *
 * ## Benefits of This Compositional Architecture
 *
 * **Separation of Concerns**: Data management is cleanly separated from computational
 * logic, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
 *
 * **Flexibility**: Different data storage strategies (dense, sparse, distributed) can
 * be combined with different operation implementations (CPU, GPU, specialized hardware)
 * without tight coupling.
 *
 * **Performance Optimization**: Data layout can be optimized independently from
 * computational algorithms, enabling targeted performance improvements.
 *
 * **Extensibility**: New data formats or operation types can be added without
 * modifying existing code, following the open-closed principle.
 *
 * **Testability**: Data and operations can be tested independently, improving
 * test coverage and reducing complexity.
 *
 * ## Usage Pattern
 *
 * The tensor acts as a unified interface that delegates data access to the `data`
 * component and computational operations to the `ops` component, providing a
 * seamless experience while maintaining the benefits of compositional design.
 *
 * @param T the data type constraint extending DType, defining the numerical precision
 * @param V the actual value type that will be stored and accessed
