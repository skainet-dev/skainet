/**
 * Strategy interface for materializing tensor views into concrete tensors.
 * 
 * Materialization is the process of converting a tensor view (which references
 * data from a parent tensor through coordinate transformations) into a standalone
 * tensor with its own data storage. Different strategies provide different
 * trade-offs between memory usage, computation time, and access patterns.
 * 
 * ## Strategy Patterns
 * 
 * - **Immediate Materialization**: Creates a copy of the view data immediately
 * - **Lazy Materialization**: Defers copying until the data is actually accessed
 * - **Reference Materialization**: Maintains references while optimizing access
 * - **Batch Materialization**: Optimizes for materializing multiple views together
 * 
 * ## Usage Context
 * 
 * Materialization strategies are particularly important for:
 * - Performance optimization when views are accessed frequently
 * - Memory management when parent tensors can be garbage collected
 * - Computational efficiency when the view will be used in multiple operations
 * - Interoperability when passing tensors between different computational backends
 * 
 * @param T the data type constraint extending DType
 * @param V the actual value type that will be stored and accessed
