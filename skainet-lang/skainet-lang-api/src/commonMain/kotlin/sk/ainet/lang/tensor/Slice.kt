/**
 * Represents a slice descriptor for tensor slicing operations.
 * 
 * Slice is a sealed class hierarchy that describes different ways to select
 * elements along a single tensor dimension. It provides the building blocks
 * for complex tensor slicing operations while maintaining type safety and
 * enabling compile-time optimization opportunities.
 * 
 * ## Slice Types
 * 
 * The sealed class hierarchy includes:
 * - **Range**: Contiguous range of indices [start, end)
 * - **At**: Single specific index selection  
 * - **All**: Full dimension selection (equivalent to [:])
 * - **Step**: Strided access with start, end, and step size
 * 
 * ## Design Principles
 * 
 * - **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees about slice validity
 * - **Composability**: Slices can be combined and normalized
 * - **Performance**: Enable optimization based on slice patterns
 * - **Expressiveness**: Support common slicing use cases
 * 
 * @param T the data type constraint extending DType
 * @param V the actual value type

     * and performance-friendly slice type.

     * ## Characteristics
     * - Always contiguous in memory
     * - Enables vectorized operations
     * - Efficient for batch processing
