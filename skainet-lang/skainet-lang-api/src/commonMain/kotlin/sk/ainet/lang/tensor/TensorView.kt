/**
 * A tensor view interface that represents a zero-copy slice or subset of a parent tensor.
 * 
 * TensorView extends the base Tensor interface while adding view-specific functionality
 * for efficient tensor slicing operations. Views provide memory-efficient access to
 * portions of larger tensors without copying the underlying data.
 * 
 * ## Key Characteristics
 * 
 * - **Zero-Copy**: Views reference the parent tensor's data without duplication
 * - **Shape Transformation**: Views can have different shapes than their parent
 * - **Index Mapping**: Coordinate transformation between view space and parent space
 * - **Memory Efficiency**: Multiple views can reference the same underlying data
 * 
 * ## Usage Patterns
 * 
 * Views are particularly useful for:
 * - Batch processing (extracting mini-batches from larger datasets)
 * - Channel extraction (accessing specific feature maps in NCHW tensors)
 * - Spatial regions (selecting rectangular areas in image tensors)
 * - Sequence windows (sliding window operations on temporal data)
 * 
 * @param T the data type constraint extending DType, defining the numerical precision
 * @param V the actual value type that will be stored and accessed
