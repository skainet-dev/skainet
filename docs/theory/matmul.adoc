= Matrix Multiplication Theory

[#matmul-definition]
== Mathematical Definition

Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices.
Given two matrices A ∈ ℝ^(m×k) and B ∈ ℝ^(k×n), the matrix product C = AB is defined as:

[stem]
++++
C_{ij} = \sum_{l=1}^{k} A_{il} \cdot B_{lj}
++++

Where:
- C ∈ ℝ^(m×n) is the resulting matrix
- i ranges from 1 to m (row index)
- j ranges from 1 to n (column index)
- l is the summation index over the shared dimension k

[#matmul-properties]
== Properties

* **Associativity**: (AB)C = A(BC)
* **Distributivity**: A(B + C) = AB + AC and (A + B)C = AC + BC
* **Non-commutativity**: Generally AB ≠ BA
* **Identity element**: AI = IA = A where I is the identity matrix

[#matmul-complexity]
== Computational Complexity

* Standard algorithm: O(mnk) operations
* Strassen's algorithm: O(n^2.807) for square matrices
* Current best known: O(n^2.373) (theoretical)
